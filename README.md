# Vue Recipes App

I wanted a place to group my recipes that I use frequently, so I am making a website for them.

## Languages

-   HTML + Pug
-   CSS + SCSS
-   Vue 3 & Javascript (to convert to TS)
-   Vitest for unit testing

## MVP:

-   Recipe cards
-   Click on recipe cards to route to the recipe in question
-   Using Pug as templating lang instead of HTML
-   Comprehensive Vitest testing

## Themes and Styling

-   Warm and homely colours, simple but intuitive design
-   PrimeVue components
-   Customised colour palette using PrimeVue's colour palette creator (imported in theme.css)
-   Responsive on narrower widths (currently navbar is responsive to 320px width)
